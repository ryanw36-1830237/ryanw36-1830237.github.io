                    <p style= "font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">The water in our bodies is essential for life. Without water, we can't survive. Water is involved in every bodily function from digestion and circulation through to the control of body temperature and the excretion of waste products. The water in our bodies is continually being used or lost from the body.</p>
                    <p style= "font-family: cursive;"> Birds are warm-blooded, egg-laying animals that have vertebrae, or a backbone. They are different from mammals because they lay hard-shelled eggs and have feathers. A bird has four limbs—two that are wings—along with a beak and no teeth.</p>

                <p class="dotted"> Disney is famous for his contributions in the field of entertainment during the 20th century. His first success was through the series, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit which was created by the Disney studio for Charles Mintz of Universal Studios. When Disney asked for a larger budget for his popular Oswald series, Mintz refused and Disney had to quit. Later, Disney and his brother Roy O. Disney started from scratch and co-founded Walt Disney Productions, now known as The Walt Disney Company. Today, this company has annual revenues of approximately U.S. $35 billion. This succes is largely due to a number of the world's most famous fictional characters he and his staff created including Mickey Mouse, a character for which Disney himself was the original voice.</p>
